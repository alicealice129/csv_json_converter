# Converter CSV/JSON and Address Geocoding

- I created a react componenet containing two text areas and 4 buttons

- One text area to input csv content
- One text areq to input json content
- One button to convert csv to json
- One button to convert json to csv
- One button to geocode the addresses
- One button to download the csv content as a file

- The file Form.js contains the component mechanics.
- The file ConvertCsvJson contains homemades functions to convert csv to array, array to csv, json to csv and csv to json, as it is homemade in a limited amount of time some csv format will not work as the specification is quite long to implement.
- The file Geocode.js contains a function getting the addresses form the json and calling a free limited geocode api.
- The geocode api is limited to 10 requests per second, and one address in the example is unknown. If an address is unknown, the function adds NAN to latitude and longitude.

- There are some consistency checks on user input. For example, empty strings or invalid json format. 

- I also add some test example using jest to test the component.

## Development Environment
- Langguage: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Framework: React.js, Material UI
- Others: jest (to test the component)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
